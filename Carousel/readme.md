    <!--
        Creating the base HTML structure for the carousel
    
        1) Create a parent div of 'carousel'
        2) Create 3 divs within the div of 'carousel' called 'carousel-item'
        3) Add images to each 'carousel-item' div, with the image src being 'images/1.jpg' - make sure to increment the image src number for each div, e.g. 'images/1.jpg', 'images/2.jpg', 'images/3.jpg' - all the images are provided in the images folder
        4) Once you have a parent div of 'carousel', and 3 'carousel-item' divs with images inside, make a new div called 'carousel-actions' which sits inside 'carousel' and not within 'carousel-item'
        5) Add two buttons inside 'carousel-actions', give them each an id, the first one being 'carousel-button-prev' and the second one being 'carousel-button-next'
        6) The content for the prev button will be '<' and the content for the next button will be '>' - arrows that show left and right
        7) On those buttons (prev & next) add aria-labels so that screen readers can read the text out loud to the user, on the previous slide button add 'Previous slide', and on the next slide button, add 'Next slide' - screen readers aren't great at describing '<' and '>' - so that's why we are adding aria-labels!
        8) Add 'carousel-item-visible' to the first 'carousel-item' class - the reason for this is because we will eventually hide all carousel items, but we always want to show the first one on loading the page!

    /*
    Styling the Carousel

    1) Set a max-width of 600px & position relative on the div 'carousel'
    2) Hide all 'carousel-item' divs
    3) Make sure all images inside 'carousel-item' have a max-width that matches the main 
    'carousel' div
    4) All images within 'carousel-item' must be responsive, so think about setting a 
    max-width on the images and how you'd make the image 100% width of 'carousel-item' 
    5) We want the first 'carousel-item' to be visible, think about the class we added 
    to the first item. Make sure that class is always shown
    6) The 'carousel-actions' needs to be on top of the slider, so think about positioning 
    and how you can use relative/absolute positioning to put the 'carousel-actions' on top of 
    the slider
    7) Make some beautiful buttons!
    8) Space those buttons from the left & right - we want to make sure they're not touching 
    the edges of the slides, but adequately spaced
*/


    1) Grab all 'carousel-item' - hint: elements...by...class name! Store this value in a const called 'slides'
    2) Set a slide position of 0 (as that's what the starting index position will be when we grab all the carousel items - remember that arrays start from 0 and not 1) - we want the slide position to always start at 0. When a user goes to the next or previous slide, we will update this--the reason it's 0 and not one is that we want to match the position in the 'slides' const that we stored above! As this is going to be changing, what seems more appropriate, a let statement or a const?
    3) Store a const value of 'totalSlides' that is equal to the length of the slides
    4) Add event listeners to both buttons 'carousel-button-next' and 'carousel-button-prev' - seeing as though we expect the user to click to change slide position, make sure we set the eventListener to 'click' and the second arguments will be functions!
    5) Create two functions: moveToNextSlide and moveToPrevSlide - use both of these in action 4 as the second argument on your 'addEventListener' - don't worry about these functions being empty, we will add to them in the upcoming screencasts
    6) Use console.log to validate that you have 3 'carousel-item' in your 'slides' const


    /*
    Moving to the next slide!
    
    1) Check if (slidePosition === totalSlides -1) (yes minus 1 because we start from 0 on 'slidePosition' - so if the slide is the last one (after a user has clicked through all the slides and then hits next again) we must reset the 'slidePosition' to 0, in turn taking them back to the first slide! 
    1: Info) Why reset? well, if we try access 'slides[slidePosition]' as such 'slides[3]' or 'slides[4]' or 'slides[5]', these don't exist (we have 3 carousel items), so we will get an error! We have [slide0, slide1, slide2] <- remember our const 'slides'? That is has an array structure in that the items index start from 0! In a none programming world, we start from 1 when counting, but this is programming, so we start counting from 0 ????
    2) Once we've done our check for slidePosition against totalSlides -1 (if this conditional is true) we reset 'slidePosition' to 0, if this conditional is not true, we increment the 'slidePosition' by 1, so we go to the next slide
    3) Within our function 'moveToNextSlide' we have a conditional, after the conditional, we want to add the class name of 'carousel-item-visible' to our current slide! 'carousel-item-visible' is our CSS class that makes the 'carousel-item' a block element (and not hidden) and shows it!
    3.1) Use 'slidePosition' to access the current array element in 'slides', and then add the class name 'carousel-item-visible', accessing an array element is as simple as 'slides[slidePosition]'
    4) Test out your next button by clicking on it, you'll see there's some clean up to do in the next Scrimba cast!

    /*
    Hiding non-active slides
    
    1) In our 'styles.css', add a new class 'carousel-item-hidden' that is set to display none
    2) Create a new function called 'hideAllSlides'
    3) Inside 'hideAllSlides' use a 'for of loop' to iterate through the slides (each iteration will give you direct access to 'carousel-item')
    4) When inside the 'for of loop', remove the class 'carousel-item-visible' and add the class 'carousel-item-hidden' - all our slides will now be hidden, and inside 'moveToNextSlide' at the end, we add back the slide we want visible!
    5) Call 'hideAllSlides' right away within the function 'moveToNextSlide' - make sure it's before any other code!
*/



/*
    Moving to the previous slide
    
    1) As we did with 'moveToNextSlide', call 'hideAllSlides' within 'moveToPrevSlide'
    2) Check if the slidePosition === 0, if it is, we know that we're on the first slide, so to go back, we take 'totalSlides' and decrease the value by 1. An example: 3-1 = 2, which gives us slidePosition 2 which is the last item in our array of slides [0, 1, 2] <- these are the indexes in the array, the actual values can be accessed by 'slides[slidePosition]' as we did for 'moveToNextSlide'
    3) If we are not on the 'slidePosition' of 0, we are not on the first slide item, therefore we just decrease 'slidePosition'. This is the reason we check for 0 prior, because if we are on 0 and try decrease from 0, we'll end up passing an index value to the 'slides' that doesn't exist - 'slides[-1]' <- like so! This will cause an error!
    4) As we did in 'moveToNextSlide', we want to add the class of 'carousel-item-visible'
    5) Check both your buttons and see the result!

/*
    Smooth transitions
    - When a new slide appears that has the class name 'carousel-item-visible' we want to trigger an animation...
    
    1) Create a new '@keyframes' at the bottom of this file called 'fadeVisibility' - kind of like a JS function! '@keyframes fadeVisibility {}'
    2) Keyframes work in steps, so 0-100 on a range. Each step you supply changes the animation sequence, e.g. 0% could be hidden and have an opacity of 0, and 100% could be showing the item by having an opacity of 1
    3) Our first keyframe step would be '0%' which sets the opacity to 0, remember that '0%' on our sequence step is not like a regular property/values, you have to use curly braces and then set your values inside there!
    4) Our second keyframe step within 'fadeVisibility' would be '100%', which sets the opacity to 1
    5) Add this keyframe animation to 'carousel-item-visible' by using the property 'animation' and pass our keyframes, those keyframes being 'fadeVisibility'
    7) Lastly after we have added our property and value to 'carousel-item-visible', we need to pass a time value (i'm going to be using seconds), so after 'animation: fadeVisibility' pass a time value. I'm going to use 0.5s - which should look like this: 'animation: fadeVisibility 0.5s'
    
    Info: So from 0% - 100% in our keyframes we wait 0.5 seconds and go from an opacity of 0, to an opacity of 1!
